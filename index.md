# Welcome to My Website! ðŸ‘‹
I'm based in Cambridge, MA.

I was born and raised in Nanjing, China. I graduated from Nanjing Foreign Language School in 2018, and I was an exchange student at Bishop Mcdevitt High School (which does not exist anymore ðŸ˜¢) in Wyncote, PA for 11th grade.

I'm a proud alum of [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) with a B.A degree in Economics and Mathematics & Statistics. (May 2022 ðŸŽ“)

I'm pursuing a Master in Finance degree at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a concentration in financial engineering.
