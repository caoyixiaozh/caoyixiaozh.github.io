# Welcome to My Website! üëã
I'm based in Cambridge, MA.

I was born and raised in Nanjing, China. I graduated from Nanjing Foreign Language School in 2018, and I was an exchange student at Bishop Mcdevitt High School (which does not exist anymore üò¢) in Wyncote, PA for 11th grade.

I'm a proud alum of [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) with a B.A degree in Economics and Mathematics & Statistics. (May 2022 üéì)

I'm pursuing a Master in Finance degree at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ü¶´, with a concentration in financial engineering.

## Projects & Papers
As a typical liberal arts student, my academic interests span widely across fields. I've studied (mostly introductory level) philosophy, sociology, political science, cognitive science, computer science, music, and English. 

However, due to limited supply of time ‚è∞ and excessive demand of sleep 
üò¥ and leisure üèñÔ∏è, I've decided to focus on the intersection of statistics, economics, and finance. 

Below is a list of my relevant projects.

- Senior Thesis (2022), [Does Speculation Make Commodity Spot Markets More Volatile? An empirical approach testing the Masters hypothesis with new evidence](https://digitallibrary.vassar.edu/collections/institutional-repository/b778c6cd-005a-4db7-8722-dc0c6643ea42): winner of the [Agnes Reynold Jackson Prize](https://www.vassar.edu/economics/courses-and-requirements/prizes-and-honors#:~:text=The%20Agnes%20Reynolds%20Jackson%20Prize,the%20best%20senior%20seminar%20paper.) for best thesis in economics
